UFO Collision Problem.
    UFOs are running into each other
    But we need collision for smashing them together

Cow Plane Collision Problem
    We need to get the AR surface somehow and give it to the wandering plane os the cows can wonder
    They also need to move better and have the animations added
    They also need to drop back down to the ground after being slightly lifted. This may be solved once actual pathfinding is in
    
Gameplay Problem
    The last cow is too easy to protect
    Possibly need a ship that just lasers down a cow, instant death and any type of targeting so multiple can fire at the same time
    
Consumables
    Need spawning for those
    Need to add lock on target to those
    Already built lock on for grabbing and damagable system for the UFOs (smash with those will just do 1 damage - tanker can do like 10)
    
Spawner
    Need to build 3 health mothership UFO and add to spawner
    Spawner is throwing errors
    
AR INPUT
    Need to test clicking on the screen when in AR mode on tablet
