UFO Collision Problem.
    UFOs are running into each other
    But we need collision for smashing them together
    
Consumables
    Need spawning for those
    
Spawner
    Need to build 3 health mothership UFO and add to spawner
    Spawner is throwing errors
    
AR INPUT
    Need to test clicking on the screen when in AR mode on tablet
    Objects render infront of environment so we need to do something about far away objects and the tractor beam size
    
Gameloop
    Start screen -> Scan Screen -> Game starts

    After player presses start to begin the game, there will be a phase where the player it told to scan their play area to create planes for the cows to spawn on.
    Once the player pressed a button to confirm their scan, it will move on to the game phase where the cows are spawned and the aliens pull up.

    Need to do something on death event call - can just show YOU DIED panel or move scene
    
Effects
    Have screen blink when life is lost - just hook into live lost event
    Better beam particles
    Game over mother ship decent
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
Gameplay Problem
    The last cow is too easy to protect
    Possibly need a ship that just lasers down a cow, instant death and any type of targeting so multiple can fire at the same time
